## [Task description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zpXXeSae-BlcxPKgw3DhxZA92cspVailrPYoaXSYrW8/edit)

## How to run the app

1- get the code either by cloning the repository or by downloading the zip file

2- install the dependencies by running `npm install`

3- build the app by running `npm run build`

4- after this you will find a folder `build` in your project, you need to open it and open the index.html file in there.

5- Alternatively, you can use the deployed version here: [Simple Caluclator](https://innowise-calculator-islam-soliman.netlify.app/)

## Folder structure

1- The root folder:

- webpack.config.js where you can find all the webpack configurations for the project

- package.json where you can find all the dependencies and the project's scripts

- eslint.config.mjs where you can find all the eslint configurations for the project

- .gitignore where you can find all the files that aren't tracked by git

- README.md where you can find the description of the project

2- The `src` folder:

Here you'll find index.html, styles.css and the JavaScript files that you need to build the project.

3- The `build` folder:

Here you'll find the two files that you need to check the project. index.html and a dinamically named JavaScript file.

## App description

In this project, I created a basic calculator using html, css, and javascript.

The calculator handles 2 operands only. In case of willing to use more operands, the result can be used as one of the operands.

The calculator can do basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports the percent and plus/minus operators.

The calculator also includes a theme switcher that allows the user to switch between light and dark mode.
